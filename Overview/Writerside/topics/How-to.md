# KTP Project
## 	To embed digital simulation tools that will increase productivity and transform it into a smart factory.
This has been done in collaboration with WD Meats and Queen's University of Belfast as a part of the Knowledge transfer partnership program funded by the Innovate UK.

## Project collaborators 

Alongside supervisors Andrew Schofield from NITC and Grace McGlen from WDMeats, the KTP project provided the candidate with essential resources:

- Technology funding: Financial support dedicated to technology acquisition or development.
- Personal development budget: Allocated funds for training, courses, or other growth opportunities.
- Travel budget: Funds to cover travel-related expenses for project-related activities or meetings.

## Overview
Traditional factories, often heavily manned and characterised by non-linear flow of data and information,
face challenges in efficiently identifying and addressing operational inefficiencies. This
disjointed information flow can lead to bottlenecks and underutilized resources. 

Digital Simulation emerges as a transformative solution in this context, facilitating a smooth transition 
of information and enabling a more integrated and transparent view of factory operations. This is achieved through technologies like Digital twins, real-time data processing and sensor fusion. 
Sensors deployed all over the factory collect vast amount of data on machine performance, environmental conditions and production times.
Identifying patterns helps industries predict potential issues, and optimize operations. 

Depending on a factory's existing production setup, whether it's non-linear and disconnected or linear and connected, the starting point
for automation varies. In a non-linear system, the initial focus may be integrating disparate data sources and establishing a foundational layer of connectivity. 
The goal here is to create a coherent flow of information, which can then be leveraged for more complex simulations.
conversely, for a linear system, the presence of a base data integration is already in place, factories can look into implementing more advanced digital simulation along with predictive analytics. 

This project represents an endeavor to assess the extent of automation possibilities within our production processes. By implementing data
acquisition systems, we aim to gather detailed insights into our current operations. This data will serve as the foundation for developing digital models, which would 
create accurate virtual models of our manufacturing environment. This will enable the senior management to make informed decisions based on concrete information and analysis, rather than relying on guesswork. 

## Goals and Projected Outcomes Over 24 Months


Initial Phase
: Complete induction and relevant training

Review and documentation phase
: Process mapping using tools to capture current processes and production layout

Identify potential areas of automation 
: Report outlining improvement opportunities and suitable automation technologies

Detailed analysis and automation
: Digital simulation of the selected area, providing insights for business case/cost analysis

Support Implementation of the project
: Successful implementation support for the automated production cell on the factory floor.

Develop and document an NPI process for future production lines
: A fully automated and embedded NPI Process for consistent application in future automation projects. 

Apply the NPI process to more complex processes, validating its effectiveness and fit for the company. 
: Presentation to management on automation solutions for complex processes and initial cost/business case review.
